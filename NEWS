Changes in RUnit 0.4.13
    o   allow the RNG to be set by the user via new arguments 'rngKind' and 'rngNormalKind' to 
        functions defineTestSuite and runTestFile (patch by Seth Falcon)
    o   fixed exit status: RNG kind was left changed after runTestSuite execution in user workspace
    o   email contact address modified

Changes in RUnit 0.4.12
    o   allow *.R test case file extension (suggested by Gregor Gorjanc)
    o   fixed code typo in example vignette (spotted by Gregor Gorjanc)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.11
    o   checkException: argument silent added to allow to suppress
        error messages emitted by the failing function
    o   inspect: added argument track, which _has_ to be provided
        at each invocation to avoid recursive default argument
        reference call errors (experimental: subject to change if this
        leads to new incompatibilities)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.9
    o   checkEquals has new compatibility argument checkNames

Changes in RUnit 0.4.8
    o   checkIdentical added, to allow to check for exact identity

Changes in RUnit 0.4.7
    o   update for checkEqualsNumeric to be compattible with R 2.3.0

Changes in RUnit 0.4.5
    o   improvements to error detection in runTestSuite

Changes in RUnit 0.4.4
    o   chaged maintainer

Changes in RUnit 0.4.2
    o   checkTrue: corrected handling of named logical arguments

Changes in RUnit 0.4.1
    o   printHTMLProtocol has new parameter 'testFileToLinkMap'
        to allow to provide a function to add dynamically generated
        URLs for each test case file, e.g. for use with CVSweb

Changes in RUnit 0.4.0

    o   New 'error' category DEACTIVATED introduced: If the function
        DEACTIVATED is inserted into a test function the function
        stops at that point and is reported as deactivated in the test
        protocol.

    o   New function 'getErrors' which takes a list of type
        'RUnitTestData' and returns some very basic error information
        of a test run.

    o   The name of the currently executed test function is written to
        standard out.

    o   'printHTMLProtocol' fixed such that it does not produce a
        warning anymore.

    o   Dependency on package 'splines' removed.

    o   Various small fixes of the documentation.
