Changes in RUnit 0.4.0

    o   New 'error' category DEACTIVATED introduced: If the function
        DEACTIVATED is inserted into a test function the function
        stops at that point and is reported as deactivated in the test
        protocol.

    o   New function 'getErrors' which takes a list of type
        'RUnitTestData' and returns some very basic error information
        of a test run.

    o   The name of the currently executed test function is written to
        standard out.

    o   'printHTMLProtocol' fixed such that it does not produce a
        warning anymore.

    o   Dependency on package 'splines' removed.

    o   Various small fixes of the documentation.
